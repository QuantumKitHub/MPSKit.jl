  abstract = {With the aim of studying nonperturbative out-of-equilibrium dynamics of high-energy particle collisions on quantum simulators, we investigate the scattering dynamics of lattice quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions. Working in the bosonized formulation of the model and in the thermodynamic limit, we use uniform-matrix-product-state tensor networks to construct multiparticle wave-packet states, evolve them in time, and detect outgoing particles post collision. This facilitates the numerical simulation of scattering experiments in both confined and deconfined regimes of the model at different energies, giving rise to rich phenomenology, including inelastic production of quark and meson states, meson disintegration, and dynamical string formation and breaking. We obtain elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections, together with time-resolved momentum and position distributions of the outgoing particles. Furthermore, we propose an analog circuit-QED implementation of the scattering process that is native to the platform, requires minimal ingredients and approximations, and enables practical schemes for particle wave-packet preparation and evolution. This study highlights the role of classical and quantum simulation in enhancing our understanding of scattering processes in quantum field theories in real time.},

In the odd-N case, the transition separates a trivial non-degenerate phase to a doubly-degenerate gapped chiral PSU(N) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase which breaks spontaneously the inversion symmetry. The transition is not an Ising transition associated to the breaking of the \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ inversion symmetry, but is governed by the delocalization of the edge states of the SPT phase. In this respect, a modulated SU(N) Heisenberg spin chain provides a simple example in one dimension of a non-Landau phase transition which is described by the SU(N)\$\_1\$ conformal field theory. We show that the chiral SPT phase exhibits fractionalized spinon excitations, which can be confined by changing the model parameters slightly.},

  abstract = {We show that, in certain circumstances, exact excitation energies appear as locally site-independent (or flat) modes if one records the excitation spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian while sweeping through the lattice in the variational matrix-product-state formulation of the density matrix renormalization group, a remarkable property since the effective Hamiltonian is only constructed to target the ground state. Conversely, modes that are very flat over several consecutive iterations are systematically found to correspond to faithful excitations. We suggest to use this property to extract accurate information about excited states using the standard ground-state algorithm. The results are spectacular for critical systems, for which the low-energy conformal tower of states can be obtained very accurately at essentially no additional cost, as demonstrated by confirming the predictions of boundary conformal field theory for two simple minimal models: the transverse-field Ising model and the critical three-state Potts model. This approach is also very efficient to detect the quasidegenerate low-energy excitations in topological phases and to identify localized excitations in systems with impurities. Finally, using the variance of the Hamiltonian as a criterion, we assess the accuracy of the resulting matrix-product-state representations of the excited states.},

  abstract = {In recent years, dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have emerged as a useful theoretical concept to characterize nonequilibrium states of quantum matter. DQPTs are marked by singular behavior in an effective free energy {$\lambda$}⁡({$t$}), which, however, is a global measure, making its experimental or theoretical detection challenging in general. We introduce two local measures for the detection of DQPTs with the advantage of requiring fewer resources than the full effective free energy. The first, called the real-local effective free energy {$\lambdaM$}⁡({$t$}), is defined in real space and is therefore suitable for systems where locally resolved measurements are directly accessible such as in quantum-simulator experiments involving Rydberg atoms or trapped ions. We test {$\lambdaM$}⁡({$t$}) in Ising chains with nearest-neighbor and power-law interactions, and find that this measure allows extraction of the universal critical behavior of DQPTs. The second measure we introduce is the momentum-local effective free energy {$\lambdak$}⁡({$t$}), which is targeted at systems where momentum-resolved quantities are more naturally accessible, such as through time-of-flight measurements in ultracold atoms. We benchmark {$\lambdak$}⁡({$t$}) for the Kitaev chain, a paradigmatic system for topological quantum matter, in the presence of weak interactions. Our introduced local measures for effective free energies can further facilitate the detection of DQPTs in modern quantum-simulator experiments.},

  abstract = {Realizations of gauge theories in setups of quantum synthetic matter open up the possibility of probing salient exotic phenomena in condensed matter and high-energy physics, along with potential applications in quantum information and science technologies. In light of the impressive ongoing efforts to achieve such realizations, a fundamental question regarding quantum link model regularizations of lattice gauge theories is how faithfully they capture the quantum field theory limit of gauge theories. Recent work {\textbackslash}cite\{zache2021achieving\} has shown through analytic derivations, exact diagonalization, and infinite matrix product state calculations that the low-energy physics of                                1                 +                 1                              D                                                   U                                  (                 1                 )                              quantum link models approaches the quantum field theory limit already at small link spin length                                S                              . Here, we show that the approach to this limit also lends itself to the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of lattice gauge theories, as demonstrated by our numerical simulations of the Loschmidt return rate and the chiral condensate in infinite matrix product states, which work directly in the thermodynamic limit. Similar to our findings in equilibrium that show a distinct behavior between half-integer and integer link spin lengths, we find that criticality emerging in the Loschmidt return rate is fundamentally different between half-integer and integer spin quantum link models in the regime of strong electric-field coupling. Our results further affirm that state-of-the-art finite-size ultracold-atom and NISQ-device implementations of quantum link lattice gauge theories have the real potential to simulate their quantum field theory limit even in the far-from-equilibrium regime.},

The method is based on an exact variational principle for dynamical correlation functions and the excited states contributing to them. This dynamical DMRG is an alternate formulation of the correction vector DMRG but is both simpler and more accurate. The finite-size scaling of spectral functions is discussed and a method for analyzing the scaling of dense spectra is described. The key idea of the method is a size-dependent broadening of the spectrum. The dynamical DMRG and the finite-size scaling analysis are demonstrated on the optical conductivity of the one-dimensional Peierls-Hubbard model. Comparisons with analytical results show that the spectral functions of infinite systems can be reproduced almost exactly with these techniques. The optical conductivity of the Mott-Peierls insulator is investigated and it is shown that its spectrum is qualitatively different from the simple spectra observed in Peierls (band) insulators and one-dimensional Mott-Hubbard insulators.},

Standard algorithms for one-dimensional systems construct model states with limited entanglement, which are a worse approximation to quantum critical states than to others. We give a quantitative theory of previously observed scaling behavior resulting from finite entanglement at quantum criticality. Finite-entanglement scaling in one-dimensional systems is governed not by the scaling dimension of an operator but by the "central charge" of the critical point. An important ingredient is the universal distribution of density-matrix eigenvalues at a critical point [P. Calabrese and A. Lefevre, Phys. Rev. A 78, 032329 (2008)]. The parameter-free theory is checked against numerical scaling at several quantum critical points.},

In the context of this lattice model, the dynamical mass generation is intimately related to the Coleman-MerminWagner and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems. In particular, the model can be interpreted as lying at the first order phase transition line between a trivial and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, which explains the degeneracy of the elementary kink excitations. We show that our Hamiltonian model can be solved analytically in the large N limit, producing the correct expression for the mass gap. Furthermore, we perform extensive numerical matrix product state simulations for N = 2, thereby recovering the emergent Lorentz symmetry and the proper non-perturbative mass gap scaling in the continuum limit. Finally, our simulations also reveal how the continuum limit manifests itself in the entanglement spectrum. As expected from conformal field theory we find two conformal towers, one tower spanned by the linear representations of O(4), corresponding to the trivial phase, and the other by the projective (i.e. spinor) representations, corresponding to the SPT phase.},

The continuous chiral symmetry, which is present in the continuum model when gx2 = gy2, has a mixed 't Hooft anomaly with the charge conservation symmetry, which guarantees the existence of a massless mode. However, the same 't Hooft anomaly also implies that the continuous chiral symmetry is broken explicitly in our lattice model. Nevertheless, from numerical matrix product state simulations we find that for certain parameters of the lattice model, the continuous chiral symmetry reemerges in the infrared fixed point theory, even at strong coupling. We argue that, in order to understand this phenomenon, it is crucial to go beyond mean-field theory (or, equivalently, beyond the leading order term in a 1/N expansion). Interestingly, on the lattice, the chiral Gross-Neveu model appears at a Landau-forbidden second order phase transition separating two distinct and unrelated symmetry-breaking orders. We point out the crucial role of two different 't Hooft anomalies or Lieb-Schultz-Mattis obstructions for this Landau-forbidden phase transition to occur.},

  abstract = {Based on the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, we introduce an ansatz for capturing excited states in finite systems with open boundary conditions, providing a very efficient method for computing, e.g., the spectral gap of quantum spin chains. This method can be straightforwardly implemented on top of an existing density-matrix renormalization group or MPS ground-state code. Although this approach is built on open-boundary MPSs, we also apply it to systems with periodic boundary conditions. Despite the explicit breaking of translation symmetry by the MPS representation, we show that momentum emerges as a good quantum number and can be exploited for labeling excitations on top of MPS ground states. We apply our method to the critical Ising chain on a ring and the classical Potts model on a cylinder. Finally, we apply the same idea to compute excitation spectra for 2D quantum systems on infinite cylinders. Again, despite the explicit breaking of translation symmetry in the periodic direction, we recover momentum as a good quantum number for labeling excitations. We apply this method to the 2D transverse-field Ising model and the half-filled Hubbard model; for the latter, we obtain accurate results for, e.g., the hole dispersion for cylinder circumferences up to eight sites.},

  abstract = {Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a powerful concept of probing far-from-equilibrium criticality in quantum many-body systems. With the strong ongoing experimental drive to quantum simulate lattice gauge theories, it becomes important to investigate DQPTs in these models in order to better understand their far-from-equilibrium properties. In this work, we use infinite matrix product state techniques to study DQPTs in spin-{$S$} {$U$}⁡(1) quantum link models. Although we are able to reproduce literature results directly connecting DQPTs to a sign change in the dynamical order parameter in the case of {$S$}=1/2 for quenches starting in a vacuum initial state, we find that for different quench protocols or different values of the link spin length {$S>$}1/2 this direct connection is no longer present. In particular, we find that there is an abundance of different types of DQPTs not directly associated with any sign change of the order parameter. Our findings indicate that DQPTs are fundamentally different between the Wilson-Kogut-Susskind limit and its representation through the quantum link formalism.},

We introduce the manifold of uniform matrix product states, show how to compute different types of observables, and discuss the concept of a tangent space. We explain how to variationally optimize ground-state approximations, implement real-time evolution and describe elementary excitations for a given model Hamiltonian. Also, we explain how matrix product states approximate fixed points of one-dimensional transfer matrices. We show how all these methods can be translated to the language of continuous matrix product states for one-dimensional field theories. We conclude with some extensions of the tangent-space formalism and with an outlook to new applications.},

  abstract = {An important class of model Hamiltonians for investigation of topological phases of matter consists of mobile, interacting particles on a lattice subject to a semiclassical gauge field, as exemplified by the bosonic Harper-Hofstadter model. A unique method for investigations of two-dimensional quantum systems are the infinite projected-entangled pair states, as they avoid spurious finite-size effects that can alter the phase structure. However, due to no-go theorems in related cases, this was often conjectured to be impossible in the past. In this Letter, we show that upon variational optimization, the infinite projected-entangled pair states can be used to this end by identifying fractional Hall states in the bosonic Harper-Hofstadter model. The obtained states are characterized by showing exponential decay of bulk correlations, as dictated by a bulk gap, as well as chiral edge modes via the entanglement spectrum.},

In the effectively one-dimensional representation of a system by matrix product states, long-ranged interactions are necessary to simulate not just many physical interactions but also higher-dimensional problems with short-ranged interactions. Since our method overcomes the restriction to short-ranged Hamiltonians of most existing methods, it proves particularly useful for studying the dynamics of both power-law interacting, one-dimensional systems, such as Coulombic and dipolar systems, and quasi-two-dimensional systems, such as strips or cylinders. First, we benchmark the method by verifying a long-standing theoretical prediction for the dynamical correlation functions of the Haldane-Shastry model. Second, we simulate the time evolution of an expanding cloud of particles in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a subject of several recent experiments.},
