    "The [hard hexagon model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_hexagon_model) is a 2-dimensional lattice model of a gas, where particles are allowed to be on the vertices of a triangular lattice, but no two particles may be adjacent.\n",

Thus, we implement away of converting integers to symmetric spaces of the given dimension, which provides a crude guess for how the final MPS would distribute its Schmidt spectrum."
