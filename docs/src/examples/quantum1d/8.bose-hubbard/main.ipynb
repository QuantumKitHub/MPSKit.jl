    "Before moving on, notice that the Hamiltonian is uniform and translationally invariant. Typically, such models are studied on a finite chain of $N$ sites with periodic boundary conditions, but this introduces finite-size effects that are rather annoying to deal with. In contrast, the MPS framework allows us to work directly in the thermodynamic limit, avoiding such artifacts. We will follow this line of exploration in this tutorial and leave finite systems for another time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work in the thermodynamic limit, we will have to create an `InfiniteMPS`. A complete specification of the MPS requires us to define the physical space and the virtual space of the constituent tensors. At this point is it useful to note that `MPSKit.jl` is powered by `TensorKit.jl` under the hood and has some very generic interfaces in order to allow imposing symmetries of all kinds. As a result, it is sometimes necessary to be a bit more explicit about what we want to do in terms of the vector spaces involved. In this case, we will not consider any symmetries and simply take the most naive approach of working within the `Trivial` sector. The physical space is then `ℂ^(nmax+1)`, and the virtual space is `ℂ^D` where $D$ is some integer chosen to be the bond dimension of the MPS, and `ℂ` is an alias for `ComplexSpace` (typeset as `\\bbC`). As $D$ is increased, one increases the amount of entanglement, i.e, quantum correlations that can be captured by the state."

This is a signature of long-range order and suggests the existence of a Bose-Einstein condensate. However, this is a bit odd since at zero temperature, the Bose Hubbard model is not expected to break any continuous symmetries ($U(1)$ in this case, corresponding to particle number conservation) due to the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the true 1D superfluid ground state is an extended critical phase exhibiting algebraic decay, however, a finite bond-dimension MPS can only capture exponentially decaying correlations. As a result, the finite bond dimension effectively introduces a length scale into the system in a similar manner as finite-size effects. We can see this clearly by increasing the bond dimension. We also see that the correlation length seems to depend algebraically on the bond dimension as expected from finite-entanglement scaling arguments."

    "We see that the density seems to peak around $k=0$, this time seemingly becoming more prominent as $D \\to \\infty$ which seems to suggest again that there is a condensate. However, going by the Penrose-Onsager criterion, the existence of a condensate can be quantified by requiring the leading eigenvalue of the single particle density matrix (i.e, $\\langle \\hat{n}_{k=0}\\rangle = \\sum_j \\langle \\hat{a}_j^{\\dagger} \\hat{a}_0\\rangle$) to diverge as $O(N)$ in the thermodynamic limit. In this case, since the correlations decay as a power law, there is naturally a divergence at low momenta. But this does not imply the existence of a condensate since the order of divergence is much weaker. However, this does indicate the remnants of some kind of condensation in the 1D model despite the quantum fluctuations, leading to the practical utility of defining the concept of a quasicondensate where there is still a notion of phase coherence over short distances.\n",

Upon applying a phase twist $\\Phi$ to the boundaries of the system, a superfluid phase would suffer an increase in energy whereas an insulating phase would not. In the thermodynamic limit, one could show that the boundary conditions may be considered as periodic and instead uniformly distribute the phase across the chain as $\\hat{a}_i \\to \\hat{a}_i e^{i\\Phi/L}$. Concretely, in the limit of $\\Phi/L \\to 0$, we have:\n",

    "Although the bond dimension here is quite low, we already see the deformation of the Mott insulator lobes to give way to the well known BKT transition that happens at commensurate density. One can go further and estimate the critical exponents using finite-entanglement scaling procedures on the correlation functions, but these may now be performed with ease using what we have learnt in this tutorial."
